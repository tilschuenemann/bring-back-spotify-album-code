# spotify codegen

![Preview](preview.png)

Spotify removed the feature to get a stitched image of an album / artist / track cover with their own [Spotify Code](https://www.spotifycodes.com/). This
package mimicks that behaviour and creates stitches, based on supplied

- URL
- URI
- query

It's also possible to use create stitches for:

- all saved albums
- 50 followed artists (limit imposed by Spotify API)

## Installation

```bash
pip install spotifycodegen
```

## Usage

`spotifycodegen` uses the Spotify API, there for you need to supply a Spotify Client ID & Token as environment variables:

```bash
export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID="yourid"
export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET="yoursecret"
```

All CLI capabilities are listed here:

```bash
